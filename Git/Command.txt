---- Configuration ----
1. Set name  ->  git config --global user.name "your name"
2. Set email ->  git config --global user.email "gmail@email.com" 

---- Basic Git command ----
1. Cloning a repository on our local machine
    git clone https://github.com/

2. displays the state of the code
    git status

3. adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
    git add filename -> single file
    git add . -> all file

4. the record of change
    git commit -m "commit msg"

5. upload local repo content to remote repo
    git push origin main

6. used to create a new git repo
    git init -> initialize a git repo
    git remote add origin lik -> add current repo to the github
    git remote -v -> to verify remote

7.  Branching in github 
    git branch -> to check branch
    git branch -M main -> to rename branch
    git checkout branch-name -> to navigate in branch
    git checkout -b branch-name -> to create new branch
    git branch -d branch-name -> to delete branch

8. Merging Branch 
    git diff branch-name -> to compare commits, branches, files & more
    git merge branch-name -> to merge 2 branches or do it manually from github

9. Fixing mistake
    Case 1 : staged changes
        git reset file-name -> for single file 
        git reset -> for all file

    Case 2 : committed changes (for one commit)
        git reset HEAD~1
        
    Case 3 : committed changes (for many commits)
        git reset commit hash 
        git reset --hard commit hash
    
10. What is Forking?
    A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.
    Fork is a rough copy.
