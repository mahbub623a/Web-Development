// EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
// EJS is a simple templating language that lets us generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

// we use EJS as blueprint. From this blueprint we can create a lot of pages that looks similar.
// Think of different user has different information but we show them in same profile page. We just change the specific info not the full page structure.
// basically we send a file as response using ejs.

// How to create it?
// First initialize the package.json file. Trick: use npm init -y -> we can skip the step by step process.
// we need to install Express
// then install ejs -> npm install ejs
